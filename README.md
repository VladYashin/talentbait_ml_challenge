• Jupyter Notebook --> Model Development, EDA, Performance, Feature Engineering etc.

• Application --> Simple simulation of production environment using terminal.

First things first. I wasn't able to upload all my models as pickle files to GitHub due to upload limitations, so there are several steps how to start with this repo:

1. Run Jupyter Notebook to save all the models locally (model_dev)
2. Run app.py to test the models (Default model is Naive Bayes)
3. Read 'verbesserungsvorschlaege.txt'
